A work in progress on my portfolio site. I will be using my Art Direction spec work from ad school, and figuring out a good way to showcase my coding skills as well.

About me page has begun to take shape. Need to start dropping in all of the content for styling, and creating new graphics.

Gulp is now running to process Sass and update stylesheet. Default, 'gulp' is 
set to watch teh .scss file.


I'm working my way through some VIM tutorials right now, so I'm going using VIM 
to update my readme.md file. VIM is actually a lot easier than I realized. 
I can understand why people get excited about it. I need to start finding 
reasons to use VIM so that I can practice and git real gud with VIM.

I'll probably start using this file as a way to practice my different VIM 
commands.

Continuing practicing some of the VIM commands that I learned last night. 
Moving and navigating is starting to stick.

Actually wishing I had some of the VIM commands in my ATOM text editor. Seeing the benefits of the Vimium chrome attachement now.

Going to finish the VIM tutorial I have been doing now.
