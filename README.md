A work in progress on my portfolio site. I will be using my Art Direction spec work from ad school, and figuring out a good way to showcase my coding skills as well.


Restarting my about me page. I want to re-organize my file structure.

Also going to get Sass and Gulp Sass set up on this project. Will update when I have it installed and running.
