<!--<p>I’m Jake, and I grew up in Northeast, Minneapolis, otherwise known as the “Arts District.” I found my love for advertising at an early age when I would sit in front of the television and watch infomercials instead of cartoons on saturday mornings. Early in life, my parents took me traveling all over the world, and it is a passion that remains instilled in me to this day. I’ve made it to four of the seven continents so far, I plan on making it to all seven.-->

    <!--The best advice I have ever received is to learn something new everyday, I do my best to stick by that.</p>-->
